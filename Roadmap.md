Below is are the projects objectives for the next year.

# Horizon 1
**Approx. next month**

See progress by reviewing [priority tickets](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/labels/priority) for the current milestone ([2019-Q2](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/milestone/1)) and/or todo list on the [main project board](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/projects/2). 

## Dev goals
_From priority tickets within the current milestone ([2019-Q2+priority](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Apriority+milestone%3A2019-Q2&utf8=%E2%9C%93))_

* Curate issues for the June [mini-sprint](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/labels/todd_mini_sprint)
* Define overall goals for summer sprints and kick-off discovery process
* Implement basic automation for manager tasks (ie move an application into a new state upon defined conditions)
* Refine the major workflow and UI features from the recently deployed winter sprints
* Identify and address what needs to be done to make the app as non-OTF specific as possible
* Ability for managers and reviewers to apply pre-defined and on-the-fly classifiers to submissions
* More capabilities for authors, reviewers, and managers to modify previously posted submissions, reviews, determinations, and comments (ie edit, delete, change visibility, revert to previous state, etc)
* Refinement of the partner functions that allow non-applicants to submit reviews and edit submissions
* Release first API version at api.opentech.fund with both authenticated endpoints for applications and public endpoints for meta data
* Improve the handling of private files
* Begin to introduce deadlines to various actions and content (ie for responding to determinations or submitting reviews)
* Add additional user account security features (ie MFA, hacked passwords, etc)
* Finish data migration from old app to current app, shutdown old app
* Performance and bug fixes always

From non-priority tickets in the current milestone ([2019-Q2-priority](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+-label%3Apriority+milestone%3A2019-Q2+))

* Harmonize the viability definitions and implement the same options for comments, reviews, and submissions
* Introduce an optional survey for applicants to complete post final-determination
* Allow users the ability to see and set their notification preferences in their profile
* Expose useful meta-data (avg amount approved, type of project, etc) from the API on internal and external pages (ie round and fund pages) 
* Improve the listing of projects, fellows, and other results on the public facing pages
* Begin offering the ability to associate a Signal number to receive and respond to notifications
* Ability for users to submit bug or feature requests from within the app or on error pages

## Discussions 
* Create list of tasks, deadlines, and stakeholders we need to interview during exploratory sessions
* What could the API/metadata inform us about current and future programming?
* What can we infer and what can we deduct from information we have at hand? Do we have complete picture and what are the gaps?

# Horizon 2
**_Approx. next 3 months_**

## Dev goals
Items from the current milestone ([2019-Q2](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/milestone/1)) not included above or from the approaching milestone ([2019-Q3](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/milestone/2)).

[todo, need to move items from above down here as is right and go through later milestone and creating high-level summaries]


* Complete mini-sprint, complete discovery, be fully into summer sprints
* Introduce and test post approval features such as PAF, invoice, monthly report, creation/management
* Review and refine as needed the current responsible data policy
* Conduct a responsible data audit
* Change the repo name to an standalone project/app name and release a website highlighting the app itself
* Create a security information page outlining the security/privacy features of the app along with our ongoing guidelines for future features


## Discussions
* What are tangible outcomes from having better access to submission information? What materials do we need to meet objectives? Do we have sufficient capacity to implement activities?
* What further internal or external UX/UI exploratory sessions should we conduct and how best to share feedback with team, applicants, and the public?
* What additional information and communication do applicants need (ie guidance, messages/comms) and how do we improve our ongoing feedback loop with them?

# Horizon 3
**_Approx. next 6 months_**

## Dev goals
Items not above from the next two or three milestones.

[todo, still need to go through these milestones to create high-level summaries like above]

## Discussions

* Should we import all the manually created PAF's into the app for a PAF central database?
* What additional tools or resources do for applicants to navigate various funds, see #697?
* * Training and how-to materials for external stakeholders

# Horizon 4
**_Approx. next 12 months_**

## Dev goals
Items not above from the next three or four milestones.

[todo, still need to go through these milestones to create high-level summaries like above]

## Discussions
* What are our goals one year from now?

The [Following Progress page](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/wiki/Following-progress) outlines how one can observe, watch, or follow the progress towards the above goals.
