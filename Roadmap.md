Below is are the projects objectives for the next year.

# Horizon 1
**Approx. next month**

See progress by reviewing [priority tickets](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/labels/priority) for the current milestone ([2019-Q2](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/milestone/1)) and/or todo list on the [main project board](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/projects/2). 

## Dev goals
_From [priority tickets within the current milestone](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Apriority+milestone%3A2019-Q2&utf8=%E2%9C%93)_

* Curate issues for the June [mini-sprint](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/labels/todd_mini_sprint)
* Define overall goals for summer sprints and kick-off discovery process

* Implement basic automation for manager tasks (ie move an application into a new state upon defined conditions)
* Refine the major workflow and UI features from the recently deployed winter sprints
* Identify and address what needs to be done to make the app as non-OTF specific as possible
* Ability for managers and reviewers to apply pre-defined and on-the-fly classifiers to submissions
* More capabilities for authors, reviewers, and managers to modify previously posted submissions, reviews, determinations, and comments (ie edit, delete, change visibility, revert to previous state, etc)
* Refinement of the partner functions that allow non-applicants to submit reviews and edit submissions
* Release first API version at api.opentech.fund with both authenticated endpoints for applications and public endpoints for meta data
* Improve the handling of private files
* Begin to introduce deadlines to various actions and content (ie for responding to determinations or submitting reviews)
* Add additional user account security features (ie MFA, hacked passwords, etc)
* Finish data migration from old app to current app, shutdown old app
* Performance and bug fixes always

From [non-priority tickets in the current milestone](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+-label%3Apriority+milestone%3A2019-Q2+)

* Harmonize the viability definitions and implement the same options for comments, reviews, and submissions
* Introduce an optional survey for applicants to complete post final-determination
* Allow users the ability to see and set their notification preferences in their profile
* Expose useful meta-data (avg amount approved, type of project, etc) from the API on internal and external pages (ie round and fund pages) 
* Improve the listing of projects, fellows, and other results on the public facing pages
* Begin offering the ability to associate a Signal number to receive and respond to notifications
* Ability for users to submit bug or feature requests from within the app or on error pages

## Discussions 
* Create list of tasks, deadlines, and stakeholders we need to interview during exploratory sessions
* What does API/metadata inform us about current and future programming?
* What can we infer and what can we deduct from information we have at hand? Do we have complete picture or are there gaps?

# Horizon 2
**_Approx. next 3 months_**

## Dev goals
Items from the [current milestone](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/milestone/1) not included above or from the [approaching milestone](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/milestone/2).

* Complete mini-sprint, complete discovery, be fully into summer sprints

## Discussions
* What are tangible results from information? What materials do we need to meet objectives? Do we have sufficient capacity to implement activities?
* UX/UI exploratory sessions and share feedback with team

What are our goals one year from now? Example: 1) Increase number of applications that focus on emergent issue from difficult to reach communities we care about  2) PAF centralize database for invoices, monthly reports, and contracts.

The [Following Progress page](https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/wiki/Following-progress) outlines how one can observe, watch, or follow the progress towards the above goals.
