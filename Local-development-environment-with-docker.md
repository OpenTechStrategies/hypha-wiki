# Setup a local development environment with Docker for Hypha


## Requirements

Recent version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).


## Domains for local development

You will need two domain to run this app. One for the public site and one for the apply site.

Add this to your `/etc/hosts` file.

~~~~
127.0.0.1 hypha.test
127.0.0.1 apply.hypha.test
~~~~

The "[test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.test)" TLD is safe to use, it's reserved for testing purposes.

OBS! All examples from now on will use the `hypha.test` domains.


## Get the code

~~~~
$ git clone git@github.com:OpenTechFund/hypha.git hypha

$ cd hypha
~~~~

OBS! Everything from now on will happen inside the hypha directory.


## Docker

### Build the Docker images

Move to the "docker" directory.

~~~~
$ cd docker
~~~~

Run the docker compose command to build the images. This will take some time.

If you need to rebuild the images to get a later version just run the "build" again.

~~~~
$ docker-compose build
~~~~


### Start the docker environment

To start the docker containers you use the "up" command. This command you will use each time you want to start up and use this docker environment.

~~~~
$ docker-compose up
~~~~


### Access the docker environment

Go to [http://hypha.test:8090/](http://hypha.test:8090/)


### Run commands in  the docker environment

To get bash shell on the container that runs the Django app, use this command.

~~~~
docker-compose exec py bash
~~~~

Here you can issue django commands as normal.

To get a shell on the container that runs Postgres, use this command.

~~~~
docker-compose exec db bash
~~~~

### Stop the docker environment.

Press `ctrl+c` in the terminal window.


## Restore a database dump in Docker

We will use the "public/sandbox_db.dump" for this example. That is a good start in any case, you get some example content etc.

First get a shell on the db container.

~~~~
docker-compose exec db bash
~~~~

Then in that shell you need to install `wget` to download the db dump.

~~~~
apt update
apt install wget
~~~~

Then download the sandbox db dump from Github.

~~~~
wget https://github.com/OpenTechFund/opentech.fund/raw/sandbox/public/sandbox_db.dump
~~~~

With this done, drop and then create the hypha database and run the pg restore command like this.

~~~
dropdb --user=hypha hypha
createdb --user=hypha hypha
pg_restore --verbose --clean --if-exists --no-acl --no-owner --dbname=hypha --username=hypha sandbox_db.dump
~~~
