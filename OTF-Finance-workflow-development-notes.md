**Contractor creates payment request**

This is the way an OTF project contractor invoices OTF for the work carried out. The information required depends on the type of contract they have with OTF.

MVP will be fixed price contract.

## Fixed Price contract
A contractor needs to be able to file a payment for request including:
- date the work started
- date the work finished
- the amount (in dollars) the invoice covers 
- the invoice file
- the option to add a comment for the payment
- choose which deliverables are covered in the payment request (the deliverable code needs to be in the list) 

### Fixed Price Contract line items
The contractor is invoicing for deliverables they have worked on. Each deliverable needs to show its individual code. Code should be of format: Programme Project Number-Vendor Number-XX-Deliverable letter
(XX: contract amendment: 0, 1, 2, etc)
(Deliverable letter: for each individual deliverable)

e.g.: 245-102-01-A
