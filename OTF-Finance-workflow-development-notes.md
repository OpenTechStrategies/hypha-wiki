Contractor creates payment request

This is the way an OTF project contractor invoices OTF for the work carried out. The information required depends on the type of contract they have with OTF. At the beginning we are focusing on a fixed price contract.

### Fixed Price contract
A contractor needs to be able to file a payment for request including:
- date the work started
- date the work finished
- the amount (in dollars) the invoice covers 
- the invoice file
- the option to add a comment for the payment

## Time and Materials contract
A contractor needs to be able to file a payment for request including:
- date the work started
- date the work finished
- the amount (in dollars) the invoice covers 
- the invoice file
- the option to add a comment for the payment
